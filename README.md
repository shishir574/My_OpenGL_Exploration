# My_OpenGL_Exploration

I have used this repository to create a project where I will be exploring OpenGL. 

The libraries included are
1. GLEW
2. GLFW
3. GLM
4. Stb_image

Here, I have covered topics such as
1. Texture mapping
2. Shaders
3. Lighting - directional, ambient
4. Mesh creation
5. window creation
6. Movement in world using - w,a,s,d keys and mouse movement

   This project isnt done yet, and i am still working on this to add and learn more features.
